2. Add a third tab for non-aggregated raw data, and the option to download
3. Improved chart styling
4. Ancillary food options (crackers, almonds, etc.)
5. Trend of cheese happiness over time
6. Possible food API integration for drop-down options
7. Unfolding cheese rating boxes (ex, appears when user clicks 'rate another cheese')
